# PGAdapter and Liquibase

PGAdapter can be used in combination with Liquibase, but with a number of limitations. This sample
shows the command line arguments and configuration that is needed in order to use Liquibase with
PGAdapter.

## Running the Sample

All the steps below assume that the commands are executed from this directory.

1. Start PGAdapter with `-ddl=AutocommitExplicitTransaction`.

```shell
wget https://storage.googleapis.com/pgadapter-jar-releases/pgadapter.tar.gz && tar -xzvf pgadapter.tar.gz
java -jar pgadapter.jar -p my-project -i my-instance -ddl=AutocommitExplicitTransaction
```

2. Manually create the `databasechangeloglock` and `databasechangelog` tables. These need to be manually
   created because the default table definition that is generated by Liquibase use `timestamp without time zone`
   instead of `timestamp with time zone`, and it would create a table without a primary key.

```shell
psql -h localhost -f create_database_change_log.sql
```
