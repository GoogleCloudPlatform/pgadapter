# Instructions

Most of the code in this directory is autogenerated. If you want to make changes, then follow these
steps:

1. Install javacc: https://javacc.github.io/javacc/
2. Make any changes that might be needed to copy.jjt and/or `CopyTreeParser.java` (the visitor methods)
3. Run `jjtree copy.jjt`. This will generate the `copy.jj` file.
4. Run `javacc copy.jj`. This will generate all the .java files.
5. Copy all .java files to the package `com.google.cloud.spanner.pgadapter.parsers.copy`
